# Hyperledger-Installer
Distributed installer for hyperledger fabric (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric)

The repository contains a collection of simple and easy to read [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) "playbooks" that provision and configure machines to develop, and run [Hyperledger](http://hyperledger.org).  

In particular, the Ansible playbooks automate the creation of an instance of the [Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric) using [Consul](https://www.consul.io/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/overview/), and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
